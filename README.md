# Sterry's Ice Cream Parlor Website  

Welcome to the **Sterry Ice Cream Parlor** project repository! This website was designed to showcase a vibrant and user-friendly interface for an ice cream parlor. While the project is currently in its early stages, significant effort has been put into crafting the design and layout.

## Done  

- **Chosen tech stack:**  
  html, css, js -  for front end, python with flask - for main mechanism and to create api ends, sqlite for database.

- **Custom Banner Design:**  
  A visually appealing banner was created to give the site a welcoming look.  

- **Font Selection:**  
  Fonts were chosen meticulously to match the theme of the site, ensuring readability and style. Multiple iterations were made to finalize the perfect font combination.  

- **UI/UX Design:**  
  A reasonable amount of time was invested in the user interface to provide an engaging and smooth experience for visitors, and yet only a portion of the design is complete due to time constraints.
